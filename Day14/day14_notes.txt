What is JWT?
------------------------------
JWT is a secure token given by the server after login .
This Token is used to prove your identity when accessing protected API's

Think of JWT like an id card

why do we need jwt?
--------------------------------
without jwt server must remember every login user&not scalable
with jwt
server does not store session
client sends token every time 
fast and secured

used in mern,rest api's,mobile apps
jwt expansion
  jwt=json web token
jwt structure
a jwt has 3 parts separated by dots:
header.payload.signature

example:
eylkhfdssaqwertyuiopzxcvbnmQQx...

Part Meaning
Header-->token type & algorithm
Payload-->user data
signature-->security lock


password is never stored in jwt?
how jwt works(flow)
login->server creates jwt ->client stores jwt->client sends jwt ->server verifies ->access allowed
Real Life Scenario
cinema example
buy ticket =login
ticket=jwt
show ticket=api request
